# PA2-Instructions
1. Create a folder named "models" in the same folder as this programming assignment. This is where the best models from each training file will be saved. 
2. You can then run any model but the baseline model by doing: `python train_{5 or 6}_{question subpart a-c}.py` in the terminal. If you want to run the baseline model, you can do so by doing: `python train.py`
4. After you run a model, a plot of the training and validation losses get saved in a plots folder.  
5. After running all the training files, you can visualize them in the visualize.ipynb file by clicking running all cells. The plots will appear towards the end of the notebook.
